## 📦 Deployment Files Ready:

### Frontend (Upload to `public_html`):
- **Location**: `c:\Users\Acer\nawabook\NAWA_CLIENT\front_end\dist\`
- **Files to upload**: All files and folders in the `dist` directory
- **Destination**: Root of your `public_html` folder in cPanel

### Backend (Upload to `nawatara` folder):
- **Location**: `c:\Users\Acer\nawabook\NAWA_CLIENT\back_end\`
- **Files to upload**: All backend files
- **Destination**: Your `nawatara` folder in cPanel

## 🔧 Step-by-Step Deployment:

### Step 1: Upload Frontend
1. Go to cPanel → File Manager
2. Navigate to `public_html`
3. Delete all existing files in `public_html` (backup first if needed)
4. Upload ALL contents from `front_end/dist/` to `public_html`
5. Extract if uploaded as zip

### Step 2: Upload Backend
1. Navigate to your `nawatara` folder in cPanel
2. Upload all files from `back_end/` folder
3. Make sure `.env` file is uploaded with production settings
4. Extract if uploaded as zip

### Step 3: Database Setup
1. Go to cPanel → Node.js Apps
2. Select your application
3. Click "Open Terminal" or "Shell Access"
4. Run these commands:
   ```bash
   cd ~/nawatara  # or your app directory
   npm install    # install dependencies
   npm run setup  # initialize database tables
   ```

### Step 4: Restart Application
1. In cPanel → Node.js Apps
2. Click "Restart" on your application
3. Wait for it to restart completely

### Step 5: Test Everything
1. Visit: `https://nawataraenglishschool.com`
2. Test login functionality
3. Test notice creation
4. Test calendar functionality

## 🗃️ Database Requirements:

Your cPanel must have a MySQL database with:
- **Database name**: `nawatara_db`
- **Database user**: `nawatara_db`
- **Password**: `Nawatara1234#`
- **User permissions**: ALL PRIVILEGES

## 🔐 Environment Variables Confirmed:

The backend `.env` file is ready with:
```env
NODE_ENV=production
MYSQL_HOST=localhost
MYSQL_PORT=3306
MYSQL_USER=nawatara_db
MYSQL_PASSWORD=Nawatara1234#
MYSQL_DATABASE=nawatara_db
JWT_SECRET=NawaSchl2025_SuperSecure_JWT_Key_MinLength32Chars!
FRONTEND_URL=https://nawataraenglishschool.com
CORS_ORIGIN=https://nawataraenglishschool.com
```

## 🚨 If You Get 500 Errors After Deployment:

1. **Check Database Setup**:
   - cPanel → MySQL Databases
   - Verify `nawatara_db` database exists
   - Verify `nawatara_db` user has full privileges

2. **Check App Logs**:
   - cPanel → Node.js Apps → Your App → Logs
   - Look for database connection errors

3. **Initialize Database Tables**:
   - In app terminal: `npm run setup`
   - This creates all required tables

4. **Restart App Again**:
   - Sometimes requires 2-3 restarts after initial setup

## 📱 Expected Results After Deployment:

✅ Login works without React errors  
✅ Calendar loads without 500 errors  
✅ Notice creation works  
✅ All admin/teacher/student features functional  
✅ No more "Minified React error #31"  
✅ Proper error messages instead of objects  

## 🆘 Emergency Contacts:

If deployment fails:
1. Check cPanel error logs first
2. Try the database setup command: `npm run setup`
3. Restart the app 2-3 times
4. Verify all files uploaded correctly

## 🎯 Success Criteria:

The deployment is successful when:
- You can login without errors
- Calendar shows events (even if empty)
- Creating notices works
- No 500 errors in browser console
- All features accessible based on user role
